# crafting-interpreters

This is my implementation of crafting interpreters.
I followed the book's implementation almost exactly.

As I worked through the book, I occasionally found it
useful to refer to the author's implementations,
which can be found on his Github [here](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters).

## Exercises

I worked through most exercises in the book.
Take a look if you if you need some ideas.
(No promises my solutions are easy to understand
or even correct. I also got stuck on some and skipped others).

### jlox

My `jlox` exercises are a mess. For each one,
I copy/pasted the implementation up to that chapter
and made a new (vaguely named) folder in `jlox`.

### clox

For `clox` I was more systematic. I got the
idea from [Chelsea Troy](https://chelseatroy.com/2022/02/10/adding-error-productions-to-the-lox-compiler/)
to have each chapter and exercise a PR of this repo.
This makes it easy to organize and see the changes
I made against the chapter implementation.
